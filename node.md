Here's a review of your code snippet:

```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 **Issues:**

* ❌ **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are used without being declared or passed as parameters. This
will lead to a `ReferenceError` in strict mode or create unintended global variables in non-strict mode, which is bad
practice.
* ❌ **Incorrect Function Signature:** A function named `sum` typically expects the numbers to be summed as arguments.
Your function takes no parameters, making its behavior dependent on external scope, which is brittle and hard to debug.
* ❌ **Lack of Input Validation:** The function assumes `a` and `b` will be numbers. If they are not (e.g., `undefined`,
`null`, strings), the `+` operator might lead to unexpected results (e.g., concatenation instead of addition, or `NaN`).
* ❌ **Missing Documentation:** There's no explanation of what the function does, what parameters it expects, or what it
returns.

✅ **Recommended Fix:**

To make the `sum` function robust, predictable, and reusable, it should accept the numbers it intends to sum as
parameters and ideally include some basic type checking and documentation.

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} num1 - The first number to be summed.
* @param {number} num2 - The second number to be summed.
* @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2. Returns NaN if inputs are not numbers.
*/
function sum(num1, num2) {
// Basic type checking for robustness
if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
console.warn('Warning: sum function received non-numeric input.');
// Consider throwing an error or handling specifically if this is an invalid state:
// throw new TypeError('Inputs to sum function must be numbers.');
}
return num1 + num2;
}

// Example Usage:
// console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
// console.log(sum(10, -2)); // Output: 8
// console.log(sum("hello", 5)); // Output: NaN (with console warning)
```

💡 **Improvements:**

* ✔ **Proper Parameter Handling:** The function now correctly accepts `num1` and `num2` as parameters, making it
self-contained and reusable.
* ✔ **Enhanced Robustness:** Includes basic type checking to alert developers if non-numeric values are passed,
preventing unexpected `NaN` or concatenation issues silently.
* ✔ **Improved Readability & Maintainability:** The function's purpose and expected inputs are clear from its signature
and the added JSDoc comments.
* ✔ **Clear Contract:** Developers using this function will understand exactly what it does and how to use it correctly.

**Final Note:**

Always strive to make your functions self-contained, predictable, and well-documented. Functions should ideally operate
only on the data they receive as input and return consistent outputs, rather than relying on external, mutable state.
